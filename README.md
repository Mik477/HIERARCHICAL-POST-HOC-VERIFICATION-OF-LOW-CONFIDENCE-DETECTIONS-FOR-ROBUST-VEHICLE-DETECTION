# Hierarchical Post-Hoc Verification for Robust Vehicle Detection

**Author:** Miká Müller
**Tutor:** Yanlong Huang

This repository contains the complete source code, data preparation pipelines, models, and evaluation scripts for the project "Hierarchical Post-Hoc Verification of Low-Confidence Detections for Robust Vehicle Detection." The project introduces a modular framework to enhance a pre-trained YOLOv11n detector with lightweight, hierarchical auxiliary heads, significantly improving tracking performance on MOT benchmarks.

## How to Run the Pipeline

This project is designed as a sequential pipeline. To reproduce the results, the scripts should be run in order. All necessary model checkpoints are included in the repository for direct evaluation. 
Necessary data has to be downloaded seperatelly.
